# HiSense Air Conditioners

This program implements the Ayla Networks LAN API to interact with HiSense WiFi Air Conditioner module, models AEH-W4B1 and AEH-W4E1, as well as Fujitsu FGLair.

As discussed [here](../../issues/1), the program doesn't seem to fit the AEH-W4A1 module, which relies on entirely different protocol (implemented by the apps [Hi-Smart Life](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qd.android.livehome), [AirConnect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oem.android.airconnect), [Smart Cool](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oem.android.livehome), [AC WIFI](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oem.android.ecold) and [טורנדו WiFi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oem.android.tornadowifi)). Please let me know if you have a different experience, or tried it with other modules.

The module is installed in A/Cs and humidifiers that are either manufactured or only branded by many other companies. These include Beko, Westinghouse, Winia, Tornado, York and more.

**This program is not affiliated with Ayla Networks, HiSense, Fujitsu, any of their subsidiaries, or any of their resellers.**

## Prerequisites

1. Air Conditioner with HiSense AEH-W4B1 or AEH-W4E1 installed, or a Fujitsu FGLair.
1. Have Python 3.10 or above installed. If using Raspberry Pi, either upgrade to Raspbian Buster, or manually install it in Raspbian Stretch.
1. Configure the A/Cs with the dedicated app. Links to each app are available in the table below. Log into the app, associate each A/C and connect it to the network, as described in the app documentation.
1. Once everything has been configured, the A/Cs can be blocked from connecting to the internet, as it will no longer be needed. Set them static IP addresses in the router, and write them down.
   * Note: _To avoid the need for manual changes later, make sure the app is aware of the new IP addresses before disconnecting the A/Cs from the internet._
1. Find the code for your app, from the list below:

## Run the A/C control server as a HomeAssistant add-on.

If using [HomeAssistant], this is the preferred method.

1. In the HomeAssistant UI, enter **Supervisor → Add-on Store**.
1. Click **⋮ menu → Repositories**.
1. Add `https://github.com/emoses/AirCon` to the list.
1. Choose **HiSense Air Conditioner** and install it.
1. Update the configuration as detailed within the add-on.
1. Start the add-on. Do not forget to enable **Start on boot** and **Watchdog**.

## Run the A/C control server in docker

Use this method if not using HomeAssistant, or if you prefer to set it up outside of HomeAssistant.

1. Download the [`docker-compose.yaml`](docker-compose.yaml) and [`options.json`](options.json). Update all the relevant fields in `options.json`:
   - For every app (multiple apps are supported), set `username` and `password` to your app login credentials, and `code` to the app code from the list above.
     These will be used to discover you A/Cs and get their LAN keys, if there are no config files in the config directory (`/opt/hisense`).
   - Set `mqtt_host` to the [MQTT] broker server, use `localhost` if running on the same host.
     Leave blank if not using [MQTT].
   - Set `mqtt_user` and `mqtt_pass` to the MQTT credentials. Leave null (or drop) if no authentication is used.
   - Set `port` to the port to be used by the web server.
   - Set `log_level` to your desired verbosity level.

1. Run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
1. Check the logs and verify that everything is in shape:
   ```bash
   journalctl CONTAINER_NAME=hisense_ac
   ```

1. Profit!
   The A/Cs should now be auto-discovered by [HomeAssistant] or [openHAB]
   (using the [HomeAssistant MQTT Components Binding](https://www.openhab.org/addons/bindings/mqtt.homeassistant/)).
   [SmartThings] requires manual setup, using the [groovy file](devicetypes/emoses/hisense-air-conditioner.src/hisense-air-conditioner.groovy), see below.

## Run the A/C control server manually

Use this method if the docker setup above does not work for you.

1. Download and install aircon module:
   ```bash
   python3.10 setup.py install
   ```

1. Run discovery command to fetch the LAN keys that will allow connecting to the A/C. Pass it your login credentials, as well as the code for your app from the list below:

   For example:
   ```bash
   python3.10 -m aircon discovery tornado-us foo@example.com my_pass
   ```
   The CLI will generate a config file for each A/C, that needs to be passed to the A/C
   control server below. You can select the A/C that the config is generated for by
   setting the `--device` flag to the device name you configured in the app.

* Note: _To update the server from head, run `git pull` on the repository and
  run setup. You may also need to re-run discovery._

1. Test out that you can run the server, e.g.:
   ```bash
   python3.10 -m aircon run --port 8888 --config config.json --mqtt_host localhost
   ```
   Parameters:
   - `--port` or `-p` - Port for the web server.
   - `--config` - The config file with the credentials to connect to the A/C.
   - `--mqtt_host` - The MQTT broker hostname or IP address. Must be set to enable MQTT.
   - `--mqtt_port` - The MQTT broker port. Default is 1883.
   - `--mqtt_client_id` - The MQTT client ID. If not set, a random client ID will be generated.
   - `--mqtt_user` - &lt;user:password&gt; for the MQTT channel. If not set, no authentication is used.
   - `--mqtt_topic` - The MQTT root topic. Default is &quot;hisense_ac&quot;. The server will listen on topics
     &lt;{mqtt_topic}/{property_name}/command&gt; and publish to &lt;{mqtt_topic}/{property_name}/status&gt;.
   - `--log_level` - The minimal log level to send to syslog. Default is WARNING.
   - `--local_ip` - The local IP address to report to the AC unit(s) as target server. Useful in case the server running this application has multiple IP addresses (e.g. in multiple VLANs), since some/most(?) AC units will refuse to report to an IP address outside of their subnet.
1. Access e.g. using curl:
   ```bash
   curl -ik 'http://localhost:8888/hisense/status'
   curl -ik 'http://localhost:8888/hisense/command?property=t_power&value=ON'
   ```

### Multiple Air Conditioners
In order to use with multiple Air Conditioners, simply add multiple --config params.
MQTT topic will contain your topic defined by flag --mqtt_topic (hisense_ac by default) and device MAC address (for uniqueness).

### Run as a service
Assuming your username is "pi"

1. Create a dedicated directory for the script files, and move the files to it.
   Pass the ownership to root. e.g.:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /opt/hisense
   sudo mv config*.json /opt/hisense
   sudo chown pi:pi /opt/hisense/*
   ```
1. Create a service configuration file (as root), e.g. `/lib/systemd/system/hisense.service`:
   ```INI
   [Unit]
   Description=Hisense A/C server
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3.10 -m aircon run --port 8888 --config config.json --mqtt_host localhost
   WorkingDirectory=/opt/hisense
   StandardOutput=inherit
   StandardError=inherit
   Restart=always
   User=pi

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```
1. Link to it from `/etc/systemd/system/`:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /lib/systemd/system/hisense.service /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/hisense.service
   ```
1. Enable and start the new service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable hisense.service
   sudo systemctl start hisense.service
   ```
1. If you use [MQTT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mqtt) for [HomeAssistant] or
   [openHAB](https://www.openhab.org/), the broker should now provide the updated status of the A/C, and accepts commands.

## SmartThings and HomeAssistant support
You will need a groovy script to enable SmartThings integration with the Air Conditioner, through the control server above.
It currently implements the main functionality (turn on/off, AC mode, fan speed, dimmer etc.).

The groovy file is available [here](devicetypes/emoses/hisense-air-conditioner.src/hisense-air-conditioner.groovy), for download and installation through the [Groovy IDE](https://graph.api.smartthings.com). As I'm continuously improving this script, it would be more efficient to use the IDE's github integration, in order to stay up-to-date.

HomeAsststant is now fully supported through [MQTT Discovery]. Properly configured devices are auto-configured and populated in the Lovelace dashboard.

## Code Contributions
Pull requests are always welcome.

Please use [YAPF] with the style config defined here to style your code.
Single quotes are used throughout the code-base. Unfortunately YAPF still doesn't support mandating this (support exists in the [fixers branch](https://github.com/google/yapf/tree/fixers)), so please be mindful.
