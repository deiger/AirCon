# HiSense Air Conditioners

This program implements the Ayla Networks LAN API to interact with HiSense WiFi Air Conditioner module, models AEH-W4B1 and AEH-W4E1, as well as Fujitsu FGLair.

As discussed [here](../../issues/1), the program doesn't seem to fit the AEH-W4A1 module, which relies on entirely different protocol (implemented by the apps [Hi-Smart Life](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qd.android.livehome), [AirConnect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oem.android.airconnect), [Smart Cool](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oem.android.livehome), [AC WIFI](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oem.android.ecold) and [טורנדו WiFi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oem.android.tornadowifi)). Please let me know if you have a different experience, or tried it with other modules.

The module is installed in A/Cs and humidifiers that are either manufactured or only branded by many other companies. These include Beko, Westinghouse, Winia, Tornado, York and more.

**This program is not affiliated with Ayla Networks, HiSense, Fujitsu, any of their subsidiaries, or any of their resellers.**

## Prerequisites

1. Air Conditioner with HiSense AEH-W4B1 or AEH-W4E1 installed.
1. Have Python installed. If using Raspberry Pi, either upgrade to Raspbian Buster, or manually install it in Raspbian Stretch.
1. Download and install aircon module:
   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```
1. Configure the A/C with the dedicated app. Links to each app are available in the table below. Log into the app, associate the A/C and connect it to the network, as described in the app documentation.
1. Once everything has been configured, the A/C can be blocked from connecting to the internet, as it will no longer be needed. Set it a static IP address in the router, and write it down.
1. Run discovery command to fetch the LAN keys that will allow connecting to the A/C. Pass it your login credentials, as well as the code for your app from the list below:

   | Code       | App Name                           | App link                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

   For example:

   ```bash
   python -m aircon tornado-us foo@example.com my_pass discovery
   ```

   The CLI will generate a config file, that needs to be passed to the A/C control server below.
   If you have more than one A/C that you would like to control, create a separate config file for each A/C, and run a separate control process. You can select the A/C that the config is generated for by setting the `--device` flag to the device name you configured in the app.

## Run the A/C control server

1. Download and install aircon module:
   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```
1. Test out that you can run the server, e.g.:
   ```bash
   python -m aircon tornado-us foo@example.com my_pass run --port 8888 --config config.json --mqtt_host localhost
   ```
   Parameters:
   - `--port` or `-p` - Port for the web server.
   - `--config` - The config file with the credentials to connect to the A/C.
   - `--device_type` - Choose which configuration to use:
     - `ac` - Hisense based A/C (default)
     - `humidifier` - Hisense Humidifier
     - `fgl` - Fujitsu FGLair, models AP-WA?E, AP-WC?E, AP-WD?E, AP-WF?E
     - `fgl_b` - Fujitsu FGLair, models AP-WB?E
   - `--mqtt_host` - The MQTT broker hostname or IP address. Must be set to enable MQTT.
   - `--mqtt_port` - The MQTT broker port. Default is 1883.
   - `--mqtt_client_id` - The MQTT client ID. If not set, a random client ID will be generated.
   - `--mqtt_user` - &lt;user:password&gt; for the MQTT channel. If not set, no authentication is used.
   - `--mqtt_topic` - The MQTT root topic. Default is &quot;hisense_ac&quot;. The server will listen on topics
     &lt;{mqtt_topic}/{property_name}/command&gt; and publish to &lt;{mqtt_topic}/{property_name}/status&gt;.
   - `--log_level` - The minimal log level to send to syslog. Default is WARNING.
1. Access e.g. using curl:
   ```bash
   curl -ik 'http://localhost:8888/hisense/status'
   curl -ik 'http://localhost:8888/hisense/command?property=t_power&value=ON'
   ```

## Run as a service

Assuming your username is "pi"

1. Create a dedicated directory for the script files, and move the files to it.
   Pass the ownership to root. e.g.:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /usr/lib/hisense
   sudo mv config.json /usr/lib/hisense
   sudo chown pi:pi /usr/lib/hisense/*
   ```
1. Create a service configuration file (as root), e.g. `/lib/systemd/system/hisense.service`:

   ```INI
   [Unit]
   Description=Hisense A/C server
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/python -m aircon tornado-us foo@example.com my_pass --port 8888 --config config.json --mqtt_host localhost
   WorkingDirectory=/usr/lib/hisense
   StandardOutput=inherit
   StandardError=inherit
   Restart=always
   User=pi

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

1. Link to it from `/etc/systemd/system/`:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /lib/systemd/system/hisense.service /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/hisense.service
   ```
1. Enable and start the new service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable hisense.service
   sudo systemctl start hisense.service
   ```
1. If you use [MQTT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mqtt) for [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) or
   [openHAB](https://www.openhab.org/), the broker should now provide the updated status of the A/C, and accepts commands.

## Multiple Air Conditioners

In order to use with multiple Air Conditioners, simply add multiple --config and --type params.
MQTT topic will contain your topic defined by flag --mqtt_topic (hisense_ac by default) and device name.

- Note: _The smart home hub configuration should adjusted to refer to the right port or topics._

## SmartThings and HomeAssistant support

I have built a groovy script to enable SmartThings integration with the Air Conditioner, through the control server above.
It currently implements the main functionality (turn on/off, AC mode, fan speed, dimmer etc.).

The groovy file is available [here](devicetypes/deiger/hisense-air-conditioner.src/hisense-air-conditioner.groovy), for download and installation through the [Groovy IDE](https://graph.api.smartthings.com). As I'm continuously improving this script, it would be more efficient to use the IDE's github integration, in order to stay up-to-date.

I've also created a configuration for HomeAssistant, available [here](hass/configuration.yaml) to communicate with the server through MQTT. Please let me know if you find issues while using it.

- Note: _If you change the `--mqtt_topic` flag, you should adjust the topics in the HomeAssistant configuration accordingly._
